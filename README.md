# Monsters Sense Fear!
This is a 2-d game where you, a cowboy are versus the pesky aliens. Your objective is to collect all the coins in the level so that you can proceed to the next level 
from the exit in the bottom right (opens on collecing all the coins).

The quirk of this game is that the monsters can smell fear. If you ever try to retreate (go left or right, which is the opposite of the direction of the exit), only then will the monsters try to move
towards you.
## Controls
The controls are the standard WASD controls. Use `R` to turn off lights to get double points when you collect a coin.

In case you just want to see how the game works, just press `P` to prevent monsters from moving, and toggle back to get back to normal.
